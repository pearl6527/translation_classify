It is likely people will write volumes about the two-plus-two dialogue between China and the United States in Alaska, as it is being held while China-U.S. relations are at a crossroads. Accordingly, these talks carry a lot of weight. The world is observing and processing the news about how China and the U.S. should recognize and work with each other, as well as whether they can deflect some of the increasingly confrontational atmosphere generated by the U.S.
The warm-up to the dialogue in Alaska began early when the U.S. released a series of tough statements intended to put pressure on China, a posture which carried over into the opening remarks of the dialogue. The U.S. has conducted unprovoked attacks on China in public speeches, particularly by calling attention to various Chinese internal affairs such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong, in an effort to intimidate China and gain an advantage in the dialogue.
Chinese interlocutors Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi have responded calmly to this change. Yang emphasized that “from the Chinese perspective, the United States is not qualified to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.” Wang said that U.S. interference in China’s internal affairs “has been a longstanding issue and it should be changed!”
This is an unprecedented and open, face-to-face confrontation between China and the U.S. not seen in recent decades. It is very antagonistic and presents a categorical adjustment to America’s long-term understanding of, and attitude toward, China. The conflict shows Washington that the U.S. cannot continue to pretend to point fingers at China, that that era is long over. The U.S. must deal with China on an equal footing and with mutual respect in order to resolve the existing problems between the two countries.
With China’s rapid development, the power gap between China and the U.S. has been rapidly narrowing. The U.S. has cultivated a sense of strategic crisis, and China-U.S. relations are extremely tumultuous. Restabilizing China-U.S. relations is the fundamental way forward, and will require viewing each other as equals and maintaining mutual respect, especially respect for each other’s core interests. The rules must be based on United Nations protocols and cannot adhere to the idea of “America first.” Unless this standard is made clear, things will be out of kilter and distorted.
Washington continues to take twisted reasoning as the truth; one by one, the U.S. and its allies brazenly preach about rules-based international order, while at the same time, they break the same rules. Everything Washington talks about is centered around the U.S. In fact, it is white supremacy. The interests of the U.S. and a few of its allies have become the starting point for discussions about right and wrong.
The Chinese delegation made a historic attempt to set things right. China’s position statement was a strong refutation to the America’s pronouncement, and China believes it has made a proper impact on U.S. inertial thinking and that it will also encourage thinking across the international community. Washington does not determine what is right and wrong in this world. Although changing Washington’s thinking on China is by no means a simple matter and is destined to happen gradually in a long game, the Alaska talks will likely be regarded as a landmark moment in history.
China still hopes to maintain normal relations with the U.S. and develop mutually beneficial cooperation. China’s wish in this regard is irreversible. After fierce opening remarks, the Chinese and American delegates entered into a closed-door substantive dialogue. The teams of the two countries have both withstood the impact of the initial confrontation, and public opinion of the two countries seems to have adjusted. We think that, within this, there are also positive signs.
China and the U.S. are the world’s two major powers, and regardless of the number of disagreements between them, neither side should act impulsively to damage these bilateral relations. In fact, coexistence and cooperation in certain ways are the only options for China and the U.S. Whether they are willing or not, both parties must learn to be patient, explore mutual compromise, and pursue win-win strategies amid the stumbling.
Both sides must actively wake up and proceed in this manner. The 21st century will not give China-U.S. relations a second chance to resolve matters.
