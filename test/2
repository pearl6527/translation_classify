Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Chunying Hua stated on March 30 that “China is staunchly opposed to any official state-level communication between the United States and Taiwan. We hope that the U.S. will be sure to consider China’s concerns, properly dealing with the question of its involvement in Taiwan with consideration. We hope this avoids additional stressors on the U.S.-China relationship.”
The Taiwan question is the most important and most sensitive matter in U.S.-China relations; it is the foundation upon which the U.S.-China relationship is built. For some time, America’s actions seriously violated the promises it made regarding its activities in the Taiwan region. Naturally, the U.S. knows about these transgressions. Even with this context in mind, the U.S. still frequently plays the “Taiwan card” against the mainland, undoubtedly exposing its sinister intention to use Taiwan to contain China.
Coincidentally, on the same day that the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson made these remarks, the amendment to the Hong Kong National Security Law was officially passed, fixing current holes in Hong Kong’s current electoral platform. This move demonstrates China’s determination and ability to safeguard its national sovereignty. With regard to Taiwan, no one, including the U.S., should underestimate China’s determination and ability.
Now, America wants to relax official contact with Taiwan. Actually, this is an extension of Donald Trump’s flawed policies, undoubtedly sending the wrong signal to the “Taiwanese independence” faction. This can only add to the instability in the Taiwan region and increase tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Thus, as the current discourse is already warning us, the will breach a dangerous red line. This can only expedite unification.
