Top diplomats from Beijing and Washington praised multilateralism at a UN Security Council meeting on Friday, but in thinly veiled criticism accused each other of undermining it.
“Splitting the world along the ideological line conflicts with a spirit of multilateralism, and is a regression in history,” said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who chaired the meeting.
Shortly afterward, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: “We will continue to push back forcefully when we see countries undermine the international order, pretend that the rules we’ve all agreed to don’t exist, or simply violate them at will.”
The comments, delivered in prepared speeches, come amid a severely deteriorated US-China relationship, with tensions running high over human rights, trade policy and territorial claims along China’s periphery.
It was the second meeting – this time, a virtual one – for Wang and Blinken during the Biden administration.
When the two diplomats sat down for talks in Alaska in March, they lashed out at each other in front of cameras – vivid evidence of the antagonism that continues to grow between the world’s two largest economies.
The UN meeting on Friday took on a more civil tone. When Blinken finished his remarks, Wang, who spoke first, offered a brief reply: “I’m sure that all countries would be glad to see the United States changing course and making a real contribution to practising multilateralism.”
he US has accused China of committing genocide against Uygurs and other Muslim minority groups in the northwest Xinjiang region, and has charged Beijing with violating trade global rules and grabbing territory in the South China Sea. China rejects those claims.
Blinken’s remarks made clear that the Biden administration’s stance on international institutions, including the United Nations, differs radically from that of former president Donald Trump.
Trump pulled the US out of the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council and the Paris climate agreement. Biden has moved to rejoin all of them.
In his speech on Friday, Blinken criticised the previous administration and said that all nations must accept scrutiny for their actions, including the US.
“I know that some of our actions in recent years have undermined the rules-based order and led others to question whether we are still committed to it,” Blinken said. “Rather than take our word for it, we ask the world to judge our commitment by our actions.”
Despite the rising tensions with the US, the European Union, India and numerous Southeast Asian nations, Wang offered a more glowing assessment of his own country’s actions in comparison, describing China’s “continuous contributions to world peace” over the last 50 years, since Beijing rejoined the UN.
“China will remain a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, a defender of international order and a provider of public goods,” he said.
But the official line insisting China has been nothing but a champion of multilateralism defies reality and undermines the country’s credibility, said Oriana Skylar Mastro, a centre fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University.
“They consistently are denying historical reality across the board,” said Skylar Mastro, who is also a senior non-resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank in Washington. “You’ll hear them say things like – their defence minister said at Shangri-La, they’ve never attacked another country. They have only defensive intentions in the South China Sea.”
“The fact that China consistently denies ever making a mistake, ever, in the international system reduces everyone’s confidence that they’re going to move away from these coercive tactics that they’ve employed,” she said.
