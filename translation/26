It cannot be denied that the United States has many assets. Its economy is highly productive and competitive while offering entrepreneurs endless opportunities. Business leaders are even free to exploit world resources and capture a nation’s territory. While the COVID-19 pandemic left every nation and all people poorer, have we not witnessed rich Americans accumulating wealth?
The assets mentioned above are par for the course … However, it is unconscionable for America to stir or wage wars at every opportunity and in every region in an attempt to demonstrate its power. Iraq’s tragic fate, as well as the events in Egypt, Libya and Syria triggered by an artificial “Arab Spring,” unfolded before our eyes and revealed America’s shameful behavior. Now it seems, the United States is debating whether to encourage Ukraine to escalate the conflict with Russia. At this point, everything is possible. Full-blown war may break out at any moment….
Washington has recently taken steps toward NATO membership for Ukraine and has sent warships to the Black Sea, testing the limits of the Montreux Convention. Fortunately, despite being a NATO member, Turkey has a sensible government with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the helm — he who, above all, seeks peace. Indeed, Turkey supports Ukraine’s claim to Crimea, but categorically condemns fueling a war.
Finally, Turkey has strengthened its call for peace after Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky met Erdogan in Istanbul. He emphasized that support for Ukraine does not equal a confrontation with Russia. We hope that America, NATO’s leading country, will one day gather its wits and act accordingly.
